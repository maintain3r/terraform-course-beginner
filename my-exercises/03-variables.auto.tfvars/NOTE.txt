### Working with *.auto.tfvars
TF does not apply values from files with values for each variable automatically as in the previous example with dev.terraform.tfvars and prod.terraform.tfvars file.
TF automatically finds nd reads variable values from files named as terraform.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.
Note that `*.auto.tfvars` will override `terraform.tfvars`. You can read more about variable precedense order in ../../08-input-vars-locals-outputs/README.md 

In this example the prod.auto.tfvars files are automatically loaded by Terraform when it runs. 
The values in the *.auto.tfvars files override the values in the terraform.tfvars file.
This means that if you have the same variable defined in both the terraform.tfvars file and an *.auto.tfvars file, the value from the *.auto.tfvars file will be used.

If you have more than 1 `*.auto.tfvars` fil ein your project directory, TF will sort the `*.auto.tfvars` filenames in alphabetical order,
and the filename that goes first gets overriden by the file that goes after it.
As an example, if we create 2 auto files - dev.auto.tfvars and prod.auto.tfvars files, dev filename goes first, then TF finds another auto file and it overrides the variables
that were in dev and now in prod auto file. This is an example of how you should avoid doing.

There might be another example where you have all your variables in `terraform.tfvars` file, but some of the variables are overriden in *.auto.tfvars file.

e.g.
$ cat terraform.tfvars
instance_type = "t2.micro"
image_id      = "11111111"
tags = {
	banagedBy = "TF"
}

$ cat prod.auto.tfvars
image_id      = "77777777"

If ou run terraform plan cmd you'll see that TF grabs `instance_type` and `tags` from terraform.tfvars file but `image_id` is "7777777".
Here's how its logic works:
- TF goes with the order of precedence from high -> low. `*.auto.tfvars` is higher than `terraform.tfvars`, it reads what it finds in it - in this case `image_id = "77777777"`.
  There's no other variable in this file.
- TF moves forward with checking for other variables in any other source and finds `terraform.tfvars` file, it reads every variable that TF didn't see in the revius file `*.auto.tfvars`,
  and again, following the variable precedence order. TF reads variable `instance_type`, `tags`, but it ignores the variable `image_id` as it has seen it coming from a more preferred source - `*.auto.tfvars.`

Don't use mutiple tfvars files that can potentially override each other!
