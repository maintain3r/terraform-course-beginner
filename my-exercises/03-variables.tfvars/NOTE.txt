Since all variable in prod and dev environments have the same name, running terraform with dev.terraform.tfvars and then prod.terraform.tfvars files
will confuse TF as it will see the changes in variable values as a change to apply to same infra.
There's a way to takle that by using TF Workspaces which will be explained in the future exercises.
Te reason of using 2 different files with values for prod and dev is to only show that TF does not apply those values automatically as both files are not named as terraform.tfvars nor *.auto.tfvars.
Also the reason was to show that passing different values from different env files may confuse TF.
