Create TF workspaces using `terraform workspace new <workspace name>`, it will automatically switch into  the new workspace
Ceate as many workspace as you need.
For each workspace create a .tfvars file matching the name of the workspaces you created.
terraform workspace list - returns a list of all workspaces
Run terraform apply -var-file=$(terraform workspace show).tfvars
or create a Bash alias
alias tf_apply='terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=$(terraform workspace show).tfvars'
$ tf_apply - will create resoruces automatically depending on which workspace you're in
After creating resources for each workspace delete the resources and workspaces. You can delete a workspace if you're inside it, you have to switch to another one before deleting.
If you want to delete TF workspace with resources in it before deleting the resources TF will throw an error,
but adding `-force` key to `terraform workspace -force delete <workspace name>` will remove the workspace and the terraform.tfstate file in it.

`terraform destroy -var-file=staging.tfvars` - destroy resources in current workspace
terraform workspace delete [-force] <workspace name> deletes the workspace
